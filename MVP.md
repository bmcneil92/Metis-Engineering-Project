## MVP 

For this project, we have created a pipeline that searches 13 cryptocurrency coin hashtags via the Twitter API, and saves them in a SQLite database.

In addition to pulling twitter data, we are also pulling the each crypto currency coin's price data from CoinBase API. 
This part of the project is still being worked on and has not been finalized.

By the end of this week, this project will have 2 datasets that can be related to each other and have active visualizations in a streamlit webpage.
